# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The crate and the npm package are
released together and share version numbers.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- A release workflow: a tag stages the npm package and, after approval, publishes the crate, through
  both registries' trusted publishing; `scripts/release.ts` bumps versions and checks tags
  (`RELEASING.md`).
- `ferrovue::push_number` and `ferrovue::Js`: numbers written as JavaScript's `Number.prototype.toString`
  writes them, held to 343 vectors recorded from JavaScript.
- `ferrovue::class_object`.
- Errors point into the `.vue` file: `components/Card.vue:12:18: …`, with the line quoted and a caret
  under the construct, mapped through the template's source map.
- `mountIslands` in `ferrovue/client`: hydrates every island on the page from its own props, sharing
  one Pinia and one router, and reports islands it cannot hydrate.
- `ferrovue --watch`, and a Vite plugin (`ferrovue/vite`) that regenerates on change and shows a
  refused construct in the error overlay.
- Generated props and types have `new(required…)` and a setter per optional field, taking strings and
  lists of strings as they come.
- Examples in the crate's API documentation.
- Fractional numbers: a `Float` prop (from `ferrovue/types`) is an `f64`; fractional literals, `/`,
  `%` by any divisor, `Math.round`/`floor`/`ceil`/`trunc`/`max`/`min`/`abs` and `.toFixed()` work as
  in JavaScript, written with `ferrovue::push_number`. `js_round`, `js_max`, `js_min` and
  `js_to_fixed` in the crate, held to 694 vectors recorded from JavaScript.
- `route.query` and `route.fullPath`, parsed as vue-router parses them: a repeated key is an array,
  written as `JSON.stringify` writes it, and `?flag` is `null`. `Route::query`, `Route::full_path` and
  `ferrovue::Query` in the crate.
- vue-i18n: `$t` and `useI18n()` (`t`, `locale`), with named and list values, plurals, literals,
  linked messages and modifiers, nested and flat keys, and fallback locales. Messages are parsed by
  vue-i18n's own message compiler into a generated `i18n` module; `ferrovue::i18n` evaluates them.
- Nested routes: `children` in the routes file, matched in vue-router's order, with
  `router-link-active` and `router-link-exact-active` (and `aria-current`) decided separately, as
  `useLink` decides them. `Router::tree`, `RouteDef` and `Link::exact` in the crate; the generated
  `route_table::ROUTES` is now a tree of `RouteDef`s.
- `<Teleport>`: markers in place and the content in the target's buffer, nested and disabled
  teleports as Vue renders them; `ferrovue::Teleports` collects them for the page to place.
- Pinia setup stores: the returned refs are the state (typed by `ref<T>()` or their initial literal),
  the returned computeds getters that may read each other, the functions actions.
- Narrowing as TypeScript narrows: `x !== undefined` as well as `x`, and `!x` or `x === undefined`
  for the `v-else`; in `?:`, `&&` and `||` as well as `v-if`. A value that is always present
  compares unequal to `undefined`; `??` and `?:` between an integer and a `Float` give a `Float`.
- `deny.toml` and a `cargo deny` CI job: every crate the workspace builds is under a licence
  compatible with MIT OR Apache-2.0 and comes from crates.io; RustSec advisories fail a release.
- The release workflow checks the crate's public API against the last version on crates.io
  (`cargo-semver-checks`): before 1.0, breaking changes need a new minor version (`RELEASING.md`).
- `pnpm coverage` (vitest's V8 coverage of the compiler, `cargo llvm-cov` of the workspace) and a
  Coverage workflow that summarises both on the run's page and uploads the reports.

### Changed

- The compiler is split into modules, its state gathered into one context; generated output is
  unchanged.
- `ferrovue` writes only the files whose text changed, and removes those no component produces, so a
  Rust build rebuilds no more than it must. `write()` returns what it changed.
- The CLI prints a refused construct as an error message, without a stack trace.
- Generated code no longer computes setup values nothing reads, nor binds loop items, narrowed values
  or slot props nothing reads; it compiles without `allow(unused_variables)`.

### Fixed

- A child component given no props at all (`<Child />`) is rendered, where it was refused with an
  error about `null`.
- Found by the randomised differential tester, and kept as conformance fixtures:
  - an integer literal beyond 2⁵³ (`1e21`) is a double, where it generated Rust that did not compile;
  - `?:` and `||` choosing between a string the component holds and one it builds, or a trim of
    one it builds (`(1).toFixed(2).trim()`), compile;
  - a class object whose names repeat, or are array indices (`"0"`, `"12"`), renders as a
    JavaScript object lists them: one entry per name, array indices first in numeric order;
  - integer arithmetic keeps JavaScript's `-0`, so dividing by it is `-Infinity`;
  - a number exactly halfway between two shortest spellings is written with the even digit, as
    ECMAScript specifies (`-1801439850948198.2`).

- Integers beyond ±2⁵³ are written, added and compared as JavaScript does with the rounded value the
  browser reads, so such a prop no longer causes a hydration mismatch.
- A class object with computed names keeps the spaces inside a name, as Vue does.
- An empty route parameter fails a debug build's render, as vue-router fails it; a release build
  still writes the link.
- vue-i18n: a fractional `count` or `n` chooses the plural case as vue-i18n does (`1.5` is
  plural, not singular), and one that is not a finite number (`NaN`, `Infinity`) is passed over
  for the plural number; a fraction that chooses no case fails a debug build's render, as vue-i18n
  throws. Found by mutation testing; the conformance component `Plurals` holds it to vue-i18n.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-04

### Added

- First standalone release of the compiler (`ferrovue` on npm) and the runtime (`ferrovue` on
  crates.io).
- `ferrovue::js_length`: a string's length in UTF-16 code units, as a template's `.length` counts it.
- The compiler accepts `:hidden` bound to any value (Vue compiles it to `ssrRenderDynamicAttr`).
- The npm package ships compiled JavaScript and type declarations (`dist/`), so the `ferrovue`
  command runs from `node_modules`.

- Script setup: lifecycle hooks, `watch`, `defineEmits`/`defineSlots`/`defineOptions`/`defineExpose`,
  template refs and plain constants; `.value` on refs in script code; a plain `<script>` block.
- Props: `withDefaults`, destructured props with defaults, optional booleans, `defineModel`,
  components without props, string-literal unions, `T | undefined`, `Array<T>`, type aliases.
- Shared types imported from `.ts` files, store files and other components (`types.rs`), and objects
  passed to child components.
- Expressions: `-`, `*`, `%`, comparisons, unary `-`, template literals, optional chaining, string
  and list methods, `Math`, `String()`, array literals; `v-for` over ranges and destructured items.
- `class` objects and conditionals; `:style` and `v-show`; `mergeProps` with any number of objects;
  global `<style>` blocks.
- Pinia getters; type imports from store files.
- Vue Router: named routes, object `to` with `params`, `query` and `hash`, `active-class`,
  `exact-active-class`, `aria-current-value`, `replace`, a history base and global link classes;
  `useRoute()` / `$route` (`path`, `hash`, `name`, `params`); `RouterLink` imported from
  `vue-router`. `Router::named`, `Router::with_base`, `Route::{param, name, hash, link_named,
  link_path}` and `query_into` in the crate; `route_table::router()` in generated code.
- `<Suspense>`, custom directives declared in `clientDirectives`; `v-model` and listeners on child
  components; clear errors for `<Teleport>`, `<component :is>`, scoped and module styles.
- Scoped slots: a `…SlotProps` struct and `…Slot` content type per scoped slot, `scoped_slot_into`
  in the crate; destructured or whole slot props in a parent; children generated before parents.
- `ferrovue::js_trim_start` and `js_trim_end`; `scripts/inspect.ts` for investigating a construct.

### Fixed

- `.length` of a string counted UTF-8 bytes, so a non-ASCII string rendered a different number
  than Vue.
- Slot content made only of comments (a `v-if` not taken, for example) was kept when the slot had
  no fallback. Vue drops it, so the bytes differed.
